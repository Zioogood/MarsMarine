# MarsMarine

MarsMarine is a game based on an idea from the Udemy course. This is a comeback to my favorite childhood movie. The whole project was made in blueprint, we have here presented mechanics such as creating waves of enemies or things like pickup, AI behavior mechanics, UI adjusted along with conditions for the appearance of ammunition or health.
